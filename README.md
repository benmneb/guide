- update 'support us' to just be an email

- minify analytics

- change the url `household/nails` to `household/nail-cosmetics` (backend needed)

- pimp out an `all categories` page.

- should say somewhere how many products with filters applied

- show `breadcrumbs` on product modal?

- autofocusing forms on page load makes keyboard cut off part of the form on mobiles devices (including `add store` input, but clicking straight on the add store button does not)

- how to stop accidental scroll on main window when filters panel scrolls for mobile?

- why does `AddProducts` not reset state onExited???

- when you log in with `ProductModal` open for a product youve already reviewed, the "add review" button doesnt say "edit review"... does this matter?

### PWA:

- stop ability to scroll results list in background while product modal is open

- before `install prompt` loads, on chrome it defaults back to "not installable, not iOS", can we detect its still installable some other way and show something else?
